# Web-Scraping-and-OCR-for-Dynamic-Webpages
This repository includes a Python-based web scraping and OCR project that extracts data from a dynamic webpage using BeautifulSoup, Pytesseract, and OCR. The information is saved as CSV for further analysis, making it useful for automating data collection from dynamic web pages


#Tools

Python: The programming language used to write the scripts for web scraping and OCR.

BeautifulSoup: A Python library for parsing HTML and XML documents, which was used to extract specific data from the webpage's HTML code.

Pytesseract: A Python wrapper for Google's Tesseract OCR engine, which was used to recognize and extract text from the webpage's images.

Requests: A Python library used to send HTTP requests to the webpage and retrieve its content.

Selenium: A Python library for automated web testing, which was used to interact with the dynamic elements of the webpage that update every 30 seconds.

Pandas: A Python library used for data manipulation and analysis, which was used to create and save the extracted data as a CSV file.

Time: A Python module used to add delays and timeouts to the scripts to ensure that the webpage was fully loaded before extracting the data.
